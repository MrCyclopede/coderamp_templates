# Python Exercise: Word Counter

## Objective:
Write a Python program that counts the number of words in a sentence provided by the user.

## Instructions:
1. **Define a function**:
   - `count_words(sentence)`: Takes a string `sentence` as input and returns the number of words in it.

2. **Prompt the user**:
   - Ask the user to enter a sentence.
   - Call the `count_words` function and display the result.

3. **Example Output**:
    ```
    Enter a sentence: Python programming is fun!
    The sentence has 4 words.
    ```

## Requirements:
- Use the `split()` method to separate words.
- Handle empty input by displaying a message if the user doesnâ€™t enter any text.
