# Python Basic Calculator

## Objective:
Create a simple calculator program in Python that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

## Instructions:
1. **Define four functions**:
   - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
   - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference of `x` and `y`.
   - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
   - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of `x` and `y`.

2. **Add a user prompt**:
   - Display a menu for the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Ask the user to enter two numbers.
   - Call the appropriate function based on the userâ€™s choice and display the result.

3. **Example Output**:
    ```
    Select operation:
    1. Add
    2. Subtract
    3. Multiply
    4. Divide

    Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 5
    Result: 10 + 5 = 15
    ```

## Requirements:
- Ensure that user input is validated (e.g., check if the numbers are numeric).
- If the user chooses division, check if the second number is not zero to avoid division by zero.
